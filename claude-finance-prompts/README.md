# claude-finance-prompts

The free companion prompt repository for *Claude AI for Finance Professionals*.

- `index.html` - the page readers land on. Self-contained: no CDN, no external
  fonts, nothing fetched at runtime. Grouped by desk, one anchor and one copy
  button per prompt, legible at 375px.
- `PROMPTS.md` - the same 122 prompts as plain Markdown.

Both files are generated. Do not hand-edit them. Regenerate from the manuscript:

    cd ~/files/kdp-books/claude-finance-professionals
    python3 build_site.py ~/files/claude-finance-prompts

Prompt numbering is the book's numbering. Prompt 47 here is Prompt 47 there.

## How it is published

Page 215 of the printed book carries
`https://tejasgjadhav.github.io/claude-finance-prompts`. **That path must stay
exactly `claude-finance-prompts`** or the printed link goes nowhere and cannot be
fixed without a reprint.

`~/files` is itself the git repository behind
`github.com/tejasgjadhav/tejasgjadhav.github.io`, the user Pages site. This
directory sits at the root of that repository, so it is served at
`/claude-finance-prompts/` with no second repo and no extra Pages setup. There is
a `.nojekyll` at the repository root, so the folder is copied verbatim.

There is no separate `claude-finance-prompts` GitHub repository and this
directory must not have its own `.git`. If one is created, the parent repository
records it as an empty gitlink and the page 404s.

To republish after regenerating:

    cd ~/files
    git add claude-finance-prompts
    git commit -m "prompt repository: regenerated"
    git push origin main

    # confirm it is live before the interior ships to KDP
    curl -sI https://tejasgjadhav.github.io/claude-finance-prompts/ | head -1

The last step must return `HTTP/2 200`. Pages can take a couple of minutes to
rebuild.

## Policy

No email gate, no sign-up form, no review request. A free resource tied to a
review ask is an incentivised review and breaks Amazon policy.
