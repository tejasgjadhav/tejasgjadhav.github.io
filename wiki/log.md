## [2026-07-03] ingest | Wiki bootstrapped from Karpathy's LLM Wiki gist
Downloaded the pattern document to sources/llm-wiki.md, wrote the schema (CLAUDE.md),
and seeded 8 project pages by surveying ~/files: files-repo (hub), institutional-trader,
jarvis, dotnet-architect-book, kdp-dashboard, trade-regimes-website, scmhrd-ai-finance,
upstox-data. Created index.md and this log. Installed /wiki-ingest, /wiki-query,
/wiki-lint skills in ~/.claude/skills/.

## [2026-07-03] ingest | Trading strategies filed from institutional-trader docs
Read institutional-trader/CLAUDE.md and studies/ (CAPITAL_CURVE_RESULTS.md et al.).
Created pages/concepts/trading-strategies.md (4-strategy lineup + validation status) and
pages/concepts/capital-curve-verdict.md. Cross-linked from institutional-trader page;
index updated. Also broadened the wiki-query skill trigger to fire on project/strategy
questions, not just explicit "check my wiki" phrasing.

## [2026-07-03] ingest | Full sweep: entities, book catalog, enriched project pages, live graph
Deep pass over all current data. New pages: entities/tejas-jadhav, entities/upstox,
entities/netlify, entities/claude-anthropic, concepts/kdp-books (all 5 titles from
kdp-dashboard/data/books.json). Enriched jarvis (Flask + Anthropic + Gmail OAuth),
kdp-dashboard, files-repo, scmhrd-ai-finance, institutional-trader, upstox-data with
cross-links. Added tools/build_graph.py + generated graph.html (interactive link graph,
self-contained, dark-mode aware); schema and skills now regenerate it on every
ingest/lint, so the graph stays live as the wiki grows.

## [2026-07-03] ingest | Real-premium fade validation (bhavcopy 2019→Sep'24 + Upstox OOS)
Filed the session's real-data results from institutional-trader/studies/STOCK_OPTIONS_NO_EDGE.md
Parts 10–11. New pages: syntheses/real-data-fade-validation (the study) and entities/nse-bhavcopy
(the free real-premium source, back to 2019). Materially revised trading-strategies: STOCK fade
CONFIRMED durable on real data (+5.3% of width, 54% win, 5/6 yrs) but modest; INDEX fade DOWNGRADED
to regime-dependent (−1.4% real, and a direction+flush gate salvage that looked like +15.1%/78%
in-sample FAILED out-of-sample on Upstox Oct'24→date, reverted). Updated institutional-trader honest
status + upstox (expired-instruments endpoint / bhavcopy split). Added cross-links + the "6 positive
years in one regime ≠ out-of-sample" lesson. index.md updated; graph refreshed.

## [2026-07-03] ingest | Zerodha Kite entity page (setup only, no secrets)
Added entities/zerodha-kite documenting the Kite Connect setup: daily access-token auth flow,
instrument_token = exchange_token × 256, and the missing expired-instruments endpoint (why
[[nse-bhavcopy]] was used instead). Deliberately did NOT store the API key/secret/access-token in the
wiki — it's a git repo; secrets stay in the gitignored institutional-trader/.env. Cross-linked from
nse-bhavcopy; index + graph updated.
